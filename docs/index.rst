============================
This package provides a Python implementation of the HYDRUS-1D unsaturated
zone model developed by Šimůnek, J., M. Th. van Genuchten, and M. Šejna.
More information on the HYDRUS-1D model is available here. This software is
licenced under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE found here. The Phydrus code is
developed by R.A. Collenteur, G. Brunetti and M. Vremec. With Phydrus,
a HYDRUS-1D model can be created, calibrated and visualized through Python
scripts, making it easy to adjust the model and providing a 100% reproducible
workflow of your modeling process.
